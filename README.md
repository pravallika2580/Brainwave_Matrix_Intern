# Task 2 Credit Card Fraud Detection

This repository contains a comprehensive project aimed at detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build models that can accurately classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent, enabling better fraud prevention systems.

# Project Overview

Credit card fraud detection is a critical application of machine learning, where models are used to identify potentially fraudulent activities among a vast number of legitimate transactions. This project applies various machine learning algorithms and data processing techniques to solve this problem effectively.

# Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis, including handling imbalanced classes and feature engineering.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and summarizing data patterns.

Model Development: Building and comparing machine learning models.

Evaluation Metrics: Using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to assess model performance.

Deployment-ready Pipeline: Organizing the workflow for practical usage.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains anonymized credit card transactions. It includes features derived from PCA transformations, as well as the Time and Amount features. The target variable (Class) indicates whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0).

# Models and Techniques
